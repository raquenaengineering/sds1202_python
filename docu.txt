First of all:

If using the wired connection for the oscilloscope, and wifi for internet,
to change preference in connection between eth and wifi needed:

in etc/dhcpcd.conf

interface eth0
metric 300

interface wlan0
metric 200

TELNET:

Installing telnet to ensure the connetion with the remote device is 
available is recommended

sudo apt install telnet
$ telnet
> open 192.168.42.190 5024

The previous commands (please note the IP may change) should return 
meassage notifying the connection from the remote oscilloscope.

SOCKETS:

Sockets come by default with python3 and are required to establish
a connection between the oscilloscope and a computer using python


SCPI: 

Scpi is a protocol to connect specifically to measurement and test devices
like oscilloscopes, function generators and others. 

It gives the possibility to use different interfaces (serial, usb, ethernet).

The goal is to implement the sds1202 to use SCPI if possible.

VISA:

It may also be possible to connect the instrument via USB, using the 
VISA libraries.
They are available for python, but may not be open source.
